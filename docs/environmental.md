# Environmental Monitoring System

## Overview

The Vervana Cultivate environmental monitoring system provides real-time tracking and analysis of shipment environmental conditions. The system focuses on two primary metrics:
- Temperature
- Humidity

## Components

### ElproTracker
The main component responsible for visualizing environmental data:
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring
- Historical data visualization
- Target range indicators
- Alerts for out-of-range conditions

### Data Collection

Environmental data is collected through:
1. IoT sensors in shipping containers
2. Regular interval measurements
3. Location-based environmental data

## Monitoring Features
